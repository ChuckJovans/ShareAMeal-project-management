 ## <h1 align="center">A SMART FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM </h1>
  
### Problem; 
There a lot of food delivery systems present in several areas. With this present meaning a lot of people make use of these systems, but it has been proved that a couple of issues and problems come to the usersâ€™ way while interacting with system. 
The main problems are unfriendly ways of interaction with most food delivery systems where by they use only English yet people from different ethnicities and tribes make use of them. Which means they should have chat bots that help people communicate in their basic language as easy and intuitive as possible. And also, another problem is Food delivery delays due to distant specific food areas such as restaurants.

### Solution;
Share A Meal, a smart food delivery system will make user interaction of the system as easy and intuitive as possible and will bridge a gap between people and the food areas. 
With Share A Meal one can order food and other related food supplies at any point in time easily with the help of an artificial intelligence (AI) powered  virtual assistant (chatbot). 
The multilingual chatbot will understand the input(order) made in form of text or speech and responds in the same manner, context and language. Once the user opens the application the multilingual chatbot will appear, the user starts a conversation with the chatbot and places an order as easy and intuitive like chatting with a friend.
 To solve the problem of food delays, this same food will come from the customers  neighbours(sellers)  and this software will also create sources of income for the neighbours who are acting as the sellers.
