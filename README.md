WRITE UP FOR SHARE A MEAL
Problem; 
Mukono as a district, the market areas and food areas are a little bit distant from many residential places, this creates difficulty in accessibility to the food and this has also increased deliberately due to lack of reliable supply and delivery systems which in turn prompts people to buy food in large quantities expensively. This definitely leads to food wastage caused by food expiring or getting spoilt due to not consuming it in time.  The other most consistent issue are the Hunger issues. These are as a result of high poverty rates in the society 
Solution; 
Share A Meal, will bridge a gap between people and the market/ food areas. With Share A Meal one can order food and other related food supplies at any point in time because this same food will come from their own neighbours and this software will also create sources of income for the neighbours who are acting as the sellers thus acting as a solution to the issue of poverty hence dissolving poverty. This will be done in a way that anyone in a given area can start their own restaurant or market at their homes and they can join the application as Sellers and these will of course be audited by experts for quality assurance. And the people who would want to buy from them will join as buyers hence not only solving the issue of inaccessibility to food and food suppliers but also creating a neighbourhood friendly environment
